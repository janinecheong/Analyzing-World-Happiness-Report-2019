# Analyzing-World-Happiness-Report-2019

In this project, we explore and visualize the distribution of happiness scores among countries, identify strong determinants and relationship of factors to one another, and apply ML Linear Regression to test the model used for the report.

Proponents of the project are Janine Cheong, Raymund Norada, Karen Salas, and Maico Rebong. This final project serves as a requirement in our Diploma Course in Foundations in Data Science under De La Salle University. This study was awarded Best in Data Analysis among the thirteen presentations.
